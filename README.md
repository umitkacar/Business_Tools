#### AGILE

The main focus of Agile is incorporating testing as early as possible and releasing a working version of the product very early by breaking down the system in to very small and manageable sub parts.

#### SCRUM

Scrum is a type of agile approach that is used in development of software applications. It is just a framework and not a methodology or a full process. It does not provide detailed instructions to what needs to be done rather most of it is dependent on the team that is developing the software. Because the developing the project knows how the problem can be solved that is why much is left on them.

The product is the primary object of a scrum project. At the end of each sprint, the system or product is brought to a shippable state by the team members.

Clearness   : The progress of the project, problems and developments should be visible to everyone.

Check       : The progress of the project is checked regularly.

Adaptation  : The project should be able to adapt to the changes that can be made.
